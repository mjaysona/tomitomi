### {frontmatter.excerpt}

As a private employee living in the Philippines, I am contacted by recruiters from time to time, some I entertain, and some do not. In cases that I do, I am often placed in a situation where I need to know the exact amount of my take-home pay for a specific percentage of increase. In those situations, what I usually do is go back to online tax calculators on the net and then input these values again in my excel sheet. Doing this every time seems like a waste of time and effort and what's worse is more often than not, these calculators are not up to date so some double-checking is needed. So, I decided to make my web app where the tax computations are already integrated and my actual take-home pay is computed with the consideration of all basic tax deductions.

You can visit the finished web app here: https://salaraise.vercel.app/

## What are we doing?

It's common sense to have the requirements ready before doing some work so I got that ready before anything else but considering that this is a project that I did in my free time, I didn't have the luxury be very detailed about it so I settled with just listing the functionalities I want this web app to initially to have.

- User should be able to calculate an increase in net income after a gross increase
  - The user should be able to input his monthly salary and the increasing percentage he wants
  - The user should see a table showing his current monthly gross salary, income tax, government deductions, and monthly net income.
  - The user should see a table showing his gross monthly salary, income tax, government deductions, and net after a gross increase.
  
- The user should be able to calculate his annual income.
  - The user should be able to input his monthly salary.
  - User should see a table showing his annual gross salary, annual income tax, annual government deductions, and annual net income.

With the requirements ready, it's time to do some digging about how the Philippine government tax works.

## Let's get to it!

Computing the overall deductions was not as simple as I thought it would be, I realized that each government deductions (SSS, Philhealth, and PAG-IBIG) has their own tables that indicates the amount to be deducted based on an employee's salary range. I needed to dig those things up in several websites just to make sure that I'm using the updated computations. 

Once I got that figured out, I know that it would be difficult to map the formulas and computations during development so I figured I'll map those on a spreadsheet first.

I won't be discussing how these are computed nor show their respective formulas here because I don't think I'll be able to present them in a way a casual reader would easily understand so I'll leave that to the expert. What I'll do instead is leave some links after this article for your reference.

Now that I got it mapped out, I think I'm ready to design my web app.

## Guess I'd have to do my own design.

I don't mind developing an app using low-fidelity mockups but I prefer if a high-fidelity mockup is available. This is so I can have a precise idea of the user interfaces that can be reused and how I can break down my components later in development. Although I was an Adobe XD user before, I decided to use Figma this time (and moving forward) to accomplish this mainly because of its free cloud service, this helps a lot because I usually switch between machines when working on projects.

When it comes to designing my projects, I like to experiment so you might find the design eccentric. This is the only time I can do whatever I want when it comes to design so please understand.

## Now, code.

For this app, I decided to use NextJS, Typescript, and SASS. There are no technical reasons why I'll be using this, I just want to brush up on my ReactJS and Typescript skills.

### Starting small with components.

My usual step after I got my local environment, configs, and folder structures setup are identify the components that I will be using and then develop them individually. For this project, I have identified the following:

- **`<Input />`** - An input component that can either be an amount or a percentage depending on its type property.
- **`<SelectDropdown />`** - A dropdown component that accepts an `Array of Objects` for its options.
- **`<ContentCard />`** - A card component that wraps a static content.
- **`<SalaryTable />`** - A table component that accepts an `Array of Objects` to generally display labels and their respective amount.

### What about pages?

Because I don't plan to add irrelevant content to this article, moving forward, additional functionalities will be accessed using the dropdown, hence this is a single-page web app.

### Stand alone methods.

Earlier, I identified the basic salary deductions. These are the Income Tax and Government Taxes that are SSS, Philhealth, and PAG-IBIG. The computation for these changes occasionally. An example would be Philhealth which is currently at a premium rate of 4% but will increase to 4.5% in 2023. To accommodate this change in the future, I made sure to have separate methods for them instead of having a single method that computes everything. This way, I can modify their respective method without affecting the other.

```js
const computeSss = (value: number): number => {
  ...
};

const computeSss = (value: number): number => {
  ...
};

const computeSss = (value: number): number => {
  ...
};

const computeWithholdingTax = (value: number): number => {
  ...
};
```

Getting the computation spot on took a bit of time because I needed to double-check and compare the results in a more reliable computation (in my opinion) I made in the spreadsheet. Once I got everything checked, I created a method that uses these methods to finally compute my take home pay or monthly net income.

```js
const netMonthly = computeNetIncome({
  ...
});
```

And then double-checked everything and compare again until I got everything right. Now that I got my components and utility methods ready to use, I was ready to create my page layout and develop my calculator.

### Must be responsive!

Okay, I got my single-page web app ready and useable in large viewports (laptops and desktops), but what about mobile? We can't possibly ignore this, right? The majority of internet users use their mobile phones. To address that, I've gone through my app components' scoped CSS and added `media queries` to handle complex layout changes when the viewport changes.

/>

Would you look at that? Looks like we're ready to go.

### Let's put this up!

I didn't really have a plan on having this in a paid domain. It's good that Next.js has first-class support from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), so it's a no-brainer. I just needed to add my web app's Git repository to my Vercel account, and all the production build was done on their end. Sweet!

## Getting some feedback and revisions.

After I got this live on production, I shared this with my friends and colleagues to gather some feedback. If you go back up to the responsive section, you'll notice that it is different compared to the initial design I had near the start of this article. Yeah, it's because the screenshots I used were from the most updated one with the changes applied from the feedback I received and not from when I just finished coding. I wasn't able to screenshot those, sorry!

## Final note.

Overall, I'm happy with how things turned out for several reasons. This project was a great introduction to Next.js and was an effective way to brush up on my React and Typescript skills which I haven't touched for years.

## What's next?
